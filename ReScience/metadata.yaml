abstract: "
This study is a partial replication of an article that presented a reliability-based arbitration mechanism between an
associative-learning strategy and a place-based navigation strategy.
This model was proposed to mimic the behavior of rats in a series of spatial navigation tasks that had
been reported in previous experimental articles. Here we present the replication of the model simulations in the first task of
the paper, a variant of the Morris water-maze task.
The original authors provided a python implementation of their model and of the simulated task.
Nevertheless, we were not able to reproduce their results without modifications to their code and model's parameters.
Furthermore, while inspecting the provided modules, we found several discrepancies with the original experimental protocol.

This article propose a modified implementation of the original code, to more accurately simulate the original
experimental protocol, and to replicate rat behavior in this adapted version of the simulated task.
We found that the original authors' computational model is able to replicate rats experimental
behavior on our modified version of the protocol."
